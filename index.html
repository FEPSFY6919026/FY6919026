Data refers to raw, unprocessed facts that are constantly being created or deleted. To discover meaningful trends or patterns in big data sets, data mining is a significant process used in many industries, notably in the business industry where customers’ data are used to optimise decision making. This article will focus on the different discussions of how the rapid development of technology throughout the years has contributed to the healthcare system. The reasons are that data mining is not only very supportive but important to the functions of the healthcare system. For example, x-rays and discovering conditions in the body the human eye cannot detect or seizure prediction devices that uses machine learning algorithms to analyse the brains activity. All of this provides information to prevents future risks. In result, it would be essential to discuss in detail how mining algorithms supports either machines or decision making.

 <p class="ex1"  id="Introduction_InText">
  There are many computational methods that analyses large-scale systems and has surged into society, in particular maps that we follow when driving. This article will explain the different data mining techniques and algorithms, the ethical point of views and how use of data mining will continue to be strongly operated in the future, especially in the healthcare industry. The discussions will explore from how data mining algorithms has introduced many beneficial systems to how safely are the patient’s privacy being protected.

 <br>
<b>Algorithms and techniques</b>
</br>
<br>
There are numerous data mining algorithms all involved when finding the diagnosis of different diseases or treatments when patients face an injury. Demonstrated by an algorithm, clustering, the process is to locate specific categories that are similar in any way, group them and decide the possibility of readmitting patients. There will be three results: k-means, X-means and K-mediods in order of the results starting from patients who have a higher chance of not being readmitted to patients having to be readmitted. (Jothi N, Rashid A, and Husain W, 2015). It uses an iterative process, which ensures accuracy in the healthcare system and successfully targets patients in intensive medicine. (Santosh D, Rohit R, Kapil M, Sandeep K, 2022). This is very crucial as healthcare data sets have increasingly enlarged therefore it would be sufficient to process the data accurately because if not patients are not able receive the support, they may require which leads to risks further in the future. Hospitals can be challenged with customers not receiving full care and this can damage their reputation.
</br>
<br>
An alternative example that is commonly recognised is decision trees, a straightforward technique that allows examination on patient’s information such as diagnosis, demographics or laboratory results also known as clinical data. Decision trees are formed of nodes and branches, where each decision will follow a path based on the circumstances being made, in result a prediction is made. (Jothi N, Rashid A, and Husain W, 2015). One example of a decision tree being used is to identify significant patterns in heart diseases. (Saeed S, Hamed B, Hamed K, 2019). The simple features questions on how care and useful it can be however decision trees enables every condition to be considered, which is useful as it can optimize the patients experience and care, and provides direction when making critical decisions. There are also disadvantages, one being problems that can surface if categorical data is included because of how biased information will evoke the decision being made to follow a certain path, as a result it gains favour for one decision over the other. Evidence and information are then not being carefully evaluated. There is uncertainty if decision trees can be used on all data, which can be considered when deciding what algorithm is useful. (Santosh D, Rohit R, Kapil M, and Sandeep K, 2022)
</br>
<br>
It is evident data mining algorithms are used very differently compared to the computing industry to the healthcare. Algorithms will have different benefits and drawbacks considering the context or what type of data it is, but the overall benefit is how data mining is so important in gathering specific information that it allows medical staff to act quickly in treating patients.
</br>
 
 <br>
<b>Ethical views using data mining in healthcare</b>
</br>

<br>There are similarities when addressing the ethical point of view of using data mining aside from the context or industry because of the subject, personal data. It is evident that with the use of patient’s personal data, such as health records, there are various aspects to consider</br>

<br>An ethical issue is the privacy of the patients, an ability to protect personal information. Privacy is one aspect that many patients are deliberate on, such as health records, because given its sensitive information patients may feel uncomfortable to share. There are instances of patient’s data being sold for research purposes and this defeats the purpose of consent. (Suzan K, Layla H, Ahmad A, 2023). Alongside this, when data is being processed, confidentiality is not being prioritised and creates a bigger risk, private information becomes exposed.</br>


<br>A discussion, already stated, algorithmic bias will be explored more. An error that can occur and produce discriminatory outcomes due to the historical data the algorithm uses. Consider a data mining algorithm based on historical, sensitive data such as demographics. For example, evaluation on clinical data sets show when strong privacy settings are involved, the model’s accuracy drops, whilst also stops detecting patterns for minority groups. (Mustaf A, John O, Majd O, Zhinya O, Shaibu M, Don L, 2025). The decisions being made will end up being very biased and certain groups will receive different care.Patients are led to be being treated differently or unfairly, which causes ethical problems to arise, this creates questions to whether data mining can guarantee an equal opportunity. For example, healthcare tools, such as hospital readmission models, predicts if a patient will require them to return, have shown biases when deciding. However, solutions have been installed with techniques, such as stratified sampling, making sure n groups are overlooked or given more time to analyse. (Mustaf A, John O, Majd O, Zhinya O, Shaibu M, Don L, 2025).</br>
</br>

 <br>
<b>Advances of data mining in healthcare</b>
</br>
<br>
The main argument is that data mining algorithms were not commonly applied in the healthcare industry years ago, one reason being how it was more difficult to mine health records that lacked structure. With the progress of data recording technology there has been a big increase of data mining and process mining in healthcare. (Marco P, Elisabetta B, Davide A, Wil V, 2024). With the changes, different patterns in data have led to new discovery and there are improvements and checks constantly being in place to ensure the data includes all groups therefore data mining algorithms and other computational methods will continue to support the healthcare system.
